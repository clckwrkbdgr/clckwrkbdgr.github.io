<h1>Coding style</h1>
<h2>Identifiers</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Classes and namespaces are named in <code>CamelCase</code>.</li>
	<li>Variables, objects, functions, methods are named <code>using_underscores</code> and <code>all_lower_case</code>.</li>
	<li>Constants are name <code>ALL_UPPERCASE_AND_UNDERSCORED</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tabs are better than spaces</h2>
<p>Tabs require fewer keystrokes to add, remove, navigate. Indent size can be set to one's preferences without actually changing code. Tabs take fewer bytes to store; extra spaces take about 10% of HTML page size. Wrong extra tab is more obvious than wrong extra space. And you can never half-indent with tabs. And soft tabs are just redundant workaround which hides horridness of space indentation.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no reason to use spaces for indentation except only one: you have prehistoric 80cols CRT display, where spaces really matters or a prehistoric compiler which supplies error lines with column number and thus displays those numbers incorrectly.</p>
<p>Still, tabs and spaces never should be mixed for indentation and no tab should be used for aligning. And there's no reason <em>not</em> to use spaces for indentation :)</p>

<h2>Giving things names</h2>
<p>Usage of Hungarian notation or other prefixes/suffixes like buttonRun, urlEdit is redundant due to their unambiguous meaning during actual using (especially when stored in containers like Qt UI or Android layouts):</p>
<pre><code>ui.url.setText(...);</code></pre>
<p>And there's no need to know which type <code>url</code> is: in current context it is actually URL and it obviously should have some text properties.</p>
<p>But still, to not mix entities from different contexts such context should be explicitly specified (like <code>ui</code> in the example above).</p>
