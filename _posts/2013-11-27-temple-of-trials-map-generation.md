Predefined dungeon was fun as a demo, but in order to create deeper dungeon a random level generator is needed. I decided to take the simplest one: 9 rooms (3x3), all laid out in one sequence, without branches. Rooms are separated by difficulty, starting with just player in a room finishing with a bunch of scorpions defending explosive in a pool of green goo. Still lame, but at least it is random.
