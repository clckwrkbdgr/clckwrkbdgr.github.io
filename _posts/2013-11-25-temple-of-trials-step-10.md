Step 10 is done. No magic, of course, but environmental hazard (like green goo that hurts feet), poisonous monsters, antidote (and edible items). Also fountains that can cure a bit. Also in this step I've changed map structure. Now every cell has link to cell type, which stores it's properties (ones that couldn't be changed during the game, like passability or ability to hurt characters). Thus it takes fewer bytes in memory and on disk.
