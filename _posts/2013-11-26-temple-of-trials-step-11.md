Simple game. Yes, it is. Kind of simple, kind of lame, fully hardcoded, but it is finished game with goal, quest item, quest completion, enemies, healing, weapons, even branches in dungeon (also lame, but still it is a branch with useful item at the end of it). Unbalanced, of course, but one could die if they really want to.  
  
Sadly, this is my first done game in a long time and it isn't even a real playable game. But feels great.
