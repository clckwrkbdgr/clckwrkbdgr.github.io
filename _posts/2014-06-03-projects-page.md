Took all projects that could possibly called as 'working' and put together the [projects page](/projects.html).
Readme, installation instructions, descriptions, licenses - all included. Most of them are licensed under WTFPLv2, some are under MIT.
Still there's long road for all of them to be called 'completed' though. Except, probably, for _Miniban_ and _Pixed_ - those are two projects I'm proud of. Sure, they need some work too, but at least they're look good and have some distinct features. Also libchthon is most completed project by the time, given the documentation and system-wide installation, but as a code it it a horrible mess.
