title: CyberCrawl re-run
---

I have no idea why I'm still doing it, but I've get old Rogue v3.1 sources and recreated CyberCrawl repo with them. Took me about a couple of house to make it work. Now it compiles, complains with message and dies with seffault. So far all seems ok.

BTW, while digging into source files I've found curious fact (I'm sure old fans of Rogue should know that, but I'm weren't until now): original Rogue was a girl. Neat.
