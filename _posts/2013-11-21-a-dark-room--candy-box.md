title: A dark room & candy box
---
Couple of web-browser-based games I discovered recently: [a dark room](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/) and [Candy Box](http://candies.aniwey.net/) (and its sequel [Candy Box 2](http://candybox2.net/)). Second one is browser RPG with resource (candies!) management part, fun quests and actually good ASCII art graphics.  
  
First one starts as village management sim in post-apocalyptic world and at some point become almost a roguelike RPG (with map, battles and everything). Gives good post-apocalyptic feeling.
