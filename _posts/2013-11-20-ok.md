Ok. I'm software developer from Ukraine who takes interest in game development (how original). I had been programming simple games since the very childhood and had desperately wanted to complete at least one of my project. Up until my old HDD went to heaven. Now I wanted to complete my projects twice as desperately. Sometimes even they come out close enough to be playable, but still, as for this moment I have exactly no game fully done whatsoever.  

Some stubs which supposed to be games and has gotten closest of all to be are stored at my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/umi0451).
