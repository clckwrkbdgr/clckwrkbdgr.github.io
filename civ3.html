<h1>Civilization3 under Linux</h1>
<p>So far I managed to run a Civilization 3: Conquests (v122) version under wine-1.0.1. Debian Squeeze, NVidia driver.</p>
<p>Following problems has been encountered:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Game tries to change resolution on start, and crashes or displays incorrectly. A way to fix this is to add a line to the game's INI-file: <code>KeepRes=1</code>. It will allow game to run using current resolution; resolution should be &gt;= Civ3's standard one (1024x768).</li>
	<li>Opening movie also can corrupt display. Line in the INI-file: <code>PlayIntro=0</code></li>
	<li>Game's internal error 13 means that it couldn't find font file LSANS.FOT, which serves as load helper for LSANS.TTF. Following commands fix that:
	<pre><code>$ cp LSANS.TTF LSANS.FOT
$ sudo chattr +i LSANS.FOT # So it can't be rewritten or deleted.</code></pre>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, installs and runs perfectly, maybe a bit slow though.</p>
<p><b>UPD</b>: There are some sound problems in game: at random time some ambient sounds would just go looping without end. The only solution I've found is to switch sound off and on again.</p>
